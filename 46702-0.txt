THE FAIRIES.


    UP the airy mountain,
      Down the rushy glen,
    We daren't go a-hunting
      For fear of little men;
    Wee folk, good folk,
      Trooping all together;
    Green jacket, red cap,
      And white owl's feather!

    Down along the rocky shore
      Some make their home,
    They live on crispy pancakes
      Of yellow tide-foam;
    Some in the reeds
      Of the black mountain-lake,
    With frogs for their watch-dogs,
      All night awake.

    High on the hill-top
      The old King sits;
    He is now so old and gray
      He's nigh lost his wits.
    With a bridge of white mist
      Columbkill he crosses,
    On his stately journeys
      From Slieveleague to Rosses;
    Or going up with music
      On cold starry nights,
    To sup with the Queen
      Of the gay Northern Lights.

    They stole little Bridget
      For seven years long;
    When she came down again
      Her friends were all gone.
    They took her lightly back,
      Between the night and morrow,
    They thought that she was fast asleep,
      But she was dead with sorrow.
    They have kept her ever since
      Deep within the lake,
    On a bed of flag-leaves,
      Watching till she wake.

    By the craggy hill-side,
      Through the mosses bare,
    They have planted thorn-trees
      For pleasure here and there.
    Is any man so daring
      As dig them up in spite,
    He shall find their sharpest thorns
      In his bed at night.

    Up the airy mountain,
      Down the rushy glen,
    We daren't go a-hunting
      For fear of little men;
    Wee folk, good folk,
      Trooping all together;
    Green jacket, red cap,
      And white owl's feather!

THE ELF SINGING.


[Illustration]

      AN Elf sat on a twig,
      He was not very big,
      He sang a little song,
      He did not think it wrong;
    But he was on a Wizard's ground,
      Who hated all sweet sound.

      Elf, Elf,
      Take care of yourself!
      He's coming behind you,
      To seize you and bind you,
      And stifle your song.
      The Wizard! the Wizard!
      He changes his shape
      In crawling along,
      An ugly old ape,
      A poisonous lizard,
      A spotted spider,
      A wormy glider,
      The Wizard! the Wizard!
      He's up on the bough,
      He'll bite through your gizzard
      He's close to you now!

[Illustration]

        The Elf went on with his song,
        It grew more clear and strong,
          It lifted him into air,
            He floated singing away,
          With rainbows in his hair;
      While the Wizard-worm from his creep
          Made a sudden leap,
          Fell down into a hole,
    And, ere his magic word he could say,
          Was eaten up by a Mole.




THE FAIRY KING.

    _"High on the hill-top
      The old King sits;
    He is now so old and gray
      He's nigh lost his wits."_


    THE Fairy King was old.
    He met the Witch of the Wold.
    "Ah ha, King!" quoth she,
    "Now thou art old like me."
    "Nay, Witch!" quoth he,
    "I am not old like thee."

    The King took off his crown,
    It almost bent him down;
    His age was too great
    To carry such a weight.
    "Give it here!" she said,
    And clapt it on her head.

    Crown sank to ground;
    The Witch no more was found.
    Then sweet spring-songs were sung,
    The Fairy King grew young,
    His crown was made of flowers,
    He lived in woods and bowers.

CHORUS OF FAIRIES.


          GOLDEN, golden,
          Light unfolding,
    Busily, merrily, work and play,
          In flowery meadows,
          And forest shadows,
    All the length of a Summer day!
    All the length of a Summer day!

          Sprightly, lightly,
          Sing we rightly,
    Moments brightly hurry away;
          Fruit-tree blossoms,
          And roses' bosoms,--
    Clear blue sky of a Summer day!
    Dear blue sky of a Summer day!

          Springlets, brooklets,
          Greeny nooklets,
    Hill and Valley, and salt sea-spray,
          Comrade rovers,
          Fairy lovers,--
    All the length of a Summer day
    All the livelong Summer day!

ROBIN REDBREAST.


    GOOD-BYE, good-bye to Summer!
      For Summer's nearly done;
    The garden smiling faintly,
      Cool breezes in the sun;
    Our Thrushes now are silent,
      Our Swallows flown away,--
    But Robin's here, in coat of brown,
      With ruddy breast-knot gay.
    Robin, Robin Redbreast,
      O Robin dear!
    Robin singing sweetly
      In the falling of the year.

    Bright yellow, red, and orange,
      The leaves come down in hosts;
    The trees are Indian Princes,
      But soon they'll turn to Ghosts;
    The scanty pears and apples
      Hang russet on the bough,
    It's Autumn, Autumn, Autumn late,
      'Twill soon be Winter now.
    Robin, Robin Redbreast,
      O Robin dear!
    And welaway! my Robin,
      For pinching times are near.

    The fireside for the Cricket,
      The wheatstack for the Mouse,
    When trembling night-winds whistle
      And moan all round the house;
    The frosty ways like iron,
      The branches plumed with snow,--
    Alas! in Winter, dead and dark,
      Where can poor Robin go?
    Robin, Robin Redbreast,
      O Robin dear,
    And a crumb of bread for Robin,
      His little heart to cheer.

[Illustration]




AMY MARGARET.


    AMY MARGARET'S five years old,
    Amy Margaret's hair is gold,
    Dearer twenty-thousand-fold
          Than gold, is Amy Margaret.

    "Amy" is friend, is "Margaret"
    The pearl for crown or carkanet?
    Or peeping daisy, Summer's pet?
          Which are you, Amy Margaret?

    A friend, a daisy, and a pearl;
    A kindly, simple, precious girl,--
    Such, howsoe'er the world may twirl,
          Be ever,--Amy Margaret!

JINGLE, JANGLE!


            JINGLE, jangle!
            Riot and wrangle!
            What shall we do
            With people like you?
            Here's Jingle!
            There's Jangle!
            Here's Riot!
            There's Wrangle!
    Never was seen such a turbulent crew!

            _You_, north must go
            To a hut of snow;
            _You_, south, in a trice,
            To an island of spice;
            _You_, off to Persia
            And sit on a hill,
            _You_, to that chair
            And be five minutes' still!

DREAMING.


          A STRANGE little Dream
          On a long star-beam
    Ran down from the midnight skies,
          To curly-hair'd Fred
          Asleep in his bed,
    With the lids on his merry blue eyes.

          Under each lid
          The thin Dream slid,
    And spread to a picture inside,
          A new World there,
          Most strange and rare,
    Tho' just by our garden-side.

          Rivers and Rocks,
          And a Treasure-Box,
    And Floating in Air without wings,
          And the Speaking Beast,
          And a Royal Feast,
    My chair beside the King's;

          A Land of Flowers,
          And of lofty Towers
    Carved over in marble white
          With living Shapes
          Of Panthers and Apes
    That gambol in ceaseless flight;

          And a Cellar small
          With its Cave in the Wall
    Stretching many a mile underground!
          And the Rope from the Moon!--
          Fred woke too soon,
    For its end could never be found.

I LOVE YOU, DEAR.

[Illustration]

    I LOVE you, Dear, I love you, Dear,
    You can't think how I love you, Dear!
            Supposing I
            Were a Butterfly,
    I'd waver around and above you, Dear.

    A long way off I spied you, Dear,
    No bonnet or hat could hide you, Dear,
            If I were a Bird,
            Believe my word,
    I'd sing every day beside you, Dear.

    When you're away I miss you, Dear,
    And now you're here I'll kiss you, Dear,
            And beg you will take
            This flow'r for my sake,
    And my love along with this, you Dear!

SEASONS.


    IN Spring-time, the Forest,
      In Summer, the Sea,
    In Autumn, the Mountains,
      In Winter,--ah me!

    How gay, the old branches
      A-swarm with new buds,
    The primrose and bluebell
      Fresh-blown in the woods,
    All green things unfolding,
      Where merry birds sing!
    I love in the Woodlands
      To wander in Spring.

    What joy, when the Sea-waves,
      In mirth and in might,
    Spread purple in shadow,
      Flash white into light!
    The gale fills the sail,
      And the gull flies away;
    In crimson and gold
      Sets the long Summer Day.

    O pride! on the Mountains
      To leave earth below;
    The great slopes of heather,
      One broad purple glow;
    The loud-roaring torrent
      Leaps, bound after bound,
    To plains of gold Autumn,
      With mist creeping round

    Ah, Wind, is it Winter?
      Yes, Winter is here;
    With snow on the meadow,
      And ice on the mere.
    The daylight is short,
      But the firelight is long;
    Our skating's good sport;
      Then story and song.

    In Spring-time, the Forest,
      In Summer, the Sea,
    In Autumn, the Mountains,--
      And Winter has glee.

THE CAT AND THE DOG.


    THERE once lived a Man, a Cat, and a Dog,
    And the Man built a house with stone and log.
    "If you'll help to take care of this house with me,
    One indoors, one out, your places must be."
    Said both together, "Indoors I'll stay!"
    And they argued the matter for half-a-day.

    "Come, let us sing for it!" purrs the Cat;
    "No!" barks the Dog, "I won't do that."
    "Come, let us fight for it!" growls Bow-wow;
    "Nay!" says Pussy, "mee-ow, mee-ow!"
    "Well, let us race for it!"--said and done.
    The course is mark'd out, and away they run.

    Puss bounded off; the Dog ran fast;
    Quickly was Puss overtaken and pass'd;
    But a Beggar who under the hedge did lie
    Struck the poor Dog as he gallop'd by
    A blow with his staff, and lessen'd his pace
    To a limp: so Pussy won the race.

    The Beggar went on his way to beg;
    Dog was cured of his limping leg;
    And Cat keeps the inside of the house,
    Watching it well from rat and mouse,
    Dog keeps the outside, ever since then,
    And always barks at beggar-men.

                 Happy and gay;

    Where's Mary? where's Mary?
      Young Mary's asleep;

      The little dreams creep.

                 Happy and gay;
               With singing and ringing,

      She has wings--she can fly!
    She has flown to the bright moon--
      Look up there and spy!

            _No, here she is! here she is!
                 Happy and gay;
               With sinking and ringing,

THE BIRD.


    "BIRDIE, Birdie, will you pet?
    Summer-time is far away yet,
    You'll have silken quilts and a velvet bed,
    And a pillow of satin for your head!"

    "I'd rather sleep in the ivy wall;
    No rain comes through, tho' I hear it fall;
    The sun peeps gay at dawn of day,
    And I sing, and wing away, away!"

    "O Birdie, Birdie, will you pet?
    Diamond-stones and amber and jet
    We'll string for a necklace fair and fine
    To please this pretty bird of mine!"

    "O thanks for diamonds, and thanks for jet,
    But here is something daintier yet,--
    A feather-necklace round and round,
    That I wouldn't sell for a thousand pound!"

    "O Birdie, Birdie, won't you pet?
    We'll buy you a dish of silver fret,
    A golden cup and an ivory seat,
    And carpets soft beneath your feet!"

    "Can running water be drunk from gold?
    Can a silver dish the forest hold?
    A rocking twig is the finest chair,
    And the softest paths lie through the air,--
    Good-bye, good-bye to my lady fair!"




WISHING.


    RING-TING! I wish I were a Primrose,
    A bright yellow Primrose blowing in the Spring!
        The stooping boughs above me,
        The wandering bee to love me,
    The fern and moss to creep across,
                And the Elm-tree for our king!

[Illustration]

    Nay--stay! I wish I were an Elm-tree,
    A great lofty Elm-tree, with green leaves gay!
        The winds would set them dancing,
        The sun and moonshine glancing,
    The Birds would house among the boughs,
                And sweetly sing!

[Illustration]

    O--no! I wish I were a Robin,
    A Robin or a little Wren, everywhere to go;
        Through forest, field, or garden,
        And ask no leave or pardon,
    Till Winter comes with icy thumbs
                To ruffle up our wing.

    Well--tell! Where should I fly to,
    Where go to sleep in the dark wood or dell?
        Before a day was over,
        Home comes the rover,
    For Mother's kiss,--sweeter this
                Than any other thing!

I SAW A LITTLE BIRDIE FLY.


    I SAW a little Birdie fly,
      Merrily piping came he;
    "Whom d'ye sing to, Bird?" said I;
      "Sing?--I sing to Amy!"

    "Very sweet you sing," I said;
      "Then," quoth he, "to pay me,
    Give one little crumb of bread,
      A little smile from Amy."

    "Just," he sings, "one little smile;
      O, a frown would slay me!
    Thanks, and now I'm gone awhile,--
      Fare-you-well, dear Amy!"

A MOUNTAIN ROUND.

(_Tyrol._)


[Illustration: Music]

    TAKE hands, merry neighbours, for dancing the round!
    Moonlight is fair and delicious the air;
    From valley to valley our music shall sound,
    And startle the wolf in his lair.
    From summits of snow to the forest below,
    Let vulture and crow hear the echoes, O-ho! (O-ho!)
    While shadow on meadow in dancing the round
    Goes whirligig, pair after pair!




THE LEPRACAUN;

OR,

FAIRY SHOEMAKER.


I.

    LITTLE Cowboy, what have you heard,
      Up on the lonely rath's green mound?
    Only the plaintive yellow bird
      Sighing in sultry fields around,
    Chary, chary, chary, chee-ee!--
    Only the grasshopper and the bee?--
            "Tip-tap, rip-rap,
            Tick-a-tack-too!
        Scarlet leather sewn together,
            This will make a shoe.
        Left, right, pull it tight;
            Summer days are warm;
        Underground in winter,
            Laughing at the storm!"
    Lay your ear close to the hill.
      Do you not catch the tiny clamour,
      Busy click of an Elfin hammer,
    Voice of the Lepracaun singing shrill
    As he merrily plies his trade?
            He's a span
            And a quarter in height.
    Get him in sight, hold him tight,
            And you're a made
                Man!


II.

    You watch your cattle the summer day,
    Sup on potatoes, sleep in the hay:
      How would you like to roll in your carriage,
      Look for a Duchess's daughter in marriage?
    Seize the Shoemaker--then you may!
             "Big boots a-hunting,
                Sandals in the hall,
              White for a wedding-feast,
                Pink for a ball.
              This way, that way,
                So we make a shoe;
              Getting rich every stitch,
                Tick-tack-too!"
    Nine-and-ninety treasure-crocks
    This keen miser-fairy hath,
    Hid in mountains, woods, and rocks,
      And where the cormorants build;
              From times of old
              Guarded by him;
              Each of them fill'd
              Full to the brim
                  With gold!


III.

    I caught him at work one day, myself,
      In the castle-ditch where foxglove grows,--
    A wrinkled, wizen'd, and bearded Elf,
      Spectacles stuck on his pointed nose,
      Silver buckles to his hose,
    Leather apron-shoe in his lap--
             "Rip-rap, tip-tap,
                Tack-tack-too!
              (A green cricket on my cap!
                Away the moth flew!)
              Buskins for a fairy prince,
                Brogues for his son,--
              Pay me well, pay me well,
                When the job is done!"
    The rogue was mine, beyond a doubt.
      I stared at him, he stared at me;
      "Servant, Sir!" "Humph!" says he,
    And pull'd a snuff-box out.
    He took a long pinch, look'd better pleased,
      The queer little Lepracaun;
    Offer'd the box with a whimsical grace,
    Pouf! he flung the dust in my face,
              And, while I sneezed,
                  Was gone!

[Illustration]

    _Raths_, very ancient forts or entrenched
    dwelling-places, usually on hills; the remains of these
    are common in Ireland, and resemble what are called
    "Rings" in England.

    _Yellow bird_, the yellow bunting, or "yorlin."

YES OR NO?


              YES or No?
              Stay or Go?
      He never can tell, he never will know!
              We must not wait,
              We'll all be late,
    While Barnaby puzzles his queer little pate!

              What do you say?
              Off and away!
      Make up your mind to go or to stay.
              Fix on your plan,
              Step out like a man,
    And follow your nose as fast as you can!

SLEEPING.


    DO all your sleeping at night,
    For then niddy-noddy is right;
        But awake you must keep,
        And it won't do to sleep,
    In the middle of broad daylight.

    The sun at the end of the day
    Takes his mighty great candle away;
        A curtain on high
        Is drawn over the sky,
    And the stars peep thro' if they may.

    There's the curtain of night over all,
    There's our own window-curtain so small,
        And least in their size,
        Over Emily's eyes
    Her fringed little eyelids will fall.

    She kneels at the side of her bed,
    And softly her prayers are said;
        Now, a kiss, my Dear;
        Come, Angels, near,
    And keep watch round the little one's bed.

A SWING SONG.


              SWING, swing,
              Sing, sing,
    Here's my throne, and I am a King!
              Swing, sing,
              Swing, sing,
    Farewell earth, for I'm on the wing!

              Low, high,
              Here I fly,
    Like a bird through sunny sky;
              Free, free,
              Over the lea,
    Over the mountain, over the sea!

              Up, down,
              Up and down,
    Which is the way to London Town?
              Where, where?
              Up in the air,
    Close your eyes, and now you are there!

              Soon, soon,
              Afternoon,
    Over the sunset, over the moon;
              Far, far,
              Over all bar,
    Sweeping on from star to star!

              No, no,
              Low, low,
    Sweeping daisies with my toe.
              Slow, slow,
              To and fro,
    Slow----
             slow------
                        slow--------
                                    slow.

[Illustration: Music]

              Swing, swing,
              sing, sing,
    Here's my throne and I am a King!
              Swing, sing,
              swing, sing,
    Farewell, earth, for I'm on the wing!

BIRDS' NAMES.


    OF Creatures with Feathers, come let us see
    Which have names like you and me.
    Hook-nosed Poll, that thinks herself pretty,
    Everyone knows, of all birds most witty.
    Friendly Daw, in suit of gray,
    Ask him his name, and 'Jack!' he'll say.
    Pert Philip Sparrow hopping you meet,
    "Philip! Philip!"--in garden and street.
    Bold Robin Redbreast perches near,
    And sings his best in the fall of the year.
    Grave Madge Owlet shuns the light,
    And shouts "hoo! hoo!" in the woods at night.
    Nightingale sweet, that May loves well,
    Old Poets have call'd her Philomel,
    But Philomelus, _he_ sings best,
    While _she_ sits listening in her nest.
    Darting Martin!--tell me why
    They call you Martin, I know not, I;
    Martin the black, under cottage eaves,
    Martin the small, in sandy caves.
    Merry Willy Wagtail, what runs he takes!
    Wherever he stops, his tail he shakes.
    Head and tail little Jenny Wren perks,
    As in and out of the hedge she jerks.
    Brisk Tom Tit, the lover of trees,
    Picks-off every fly and grub he sees.
    Mag, the cunning chattering Pie,
    Builds her home in a tree-top high,--
    Mag, you're a terrible thief, O fie!

        Tom and Philip and Jenny and Polly,
    Madge and Martin and Robin and Willy,
    Philomelus and friendly Jack,--
    Mag the rogue, half-white, half-black,
    Stole an egg from every Bird;
    Such an uproar was never heard;
    All of them flew upon Mag together,
    And pluck'd her naked of every feather.
    "You're not a Bird!" they told her then,
    "You may go away and live among men!"

DOWN ON THE SHORE.


I.

      DOWN on the shore, on the sunny shore!
        Where the salt smell cheers the land;
      Where the tide moves bright under boundless light,
        And the surge on the glittering strand;
      Where the children wade in the shallow pools,
        Or run from the froth in play;
      While the swift little boats with milk-white wings
        Are crossing the sapphire bay,
      And the ship in full sail, with a fortunate gale
        Holds proudly on her way;
      Where the nets are spread on the grass to dry,
      And asleep, hard by, the fishermen lie,
      Under the tent of the warm blue sky,
    With the hushing wave on its golden floor
            To sing their lullaby.


II.

      Down on the shore, on the stormy shore!
        Beset by a growling sea,
      Whose mad waves leap on the rocky steep
        Like wolves up a traveller's tree:
      Where the foam flies wide, and an angry blast
        Blows the curlew off, with a screech;
      Where the brown sea-wrack, torn up by the roots,
        Is flung out of fishes' reach;
      And the tall ship rolls on the hidden shoals,
        And scatters her planks on the beach;
      Where slate and straw through the village spin,
      And a cottage fronts the fiercest din
      With a sailor's wife sitting sad within,
    Hearkening the wind and the water's roar,
            Till at last her tears begin.

[Illustration]




THE BUBBLE.


    SEE, the pretty Planet!
        Floating sphere!
    Faintest breeze will fan it
        Far or near;

    World as light as feather;
        Moonshine rays,
    Rainbow tints, together,
        As it plays;

    Drooping, sinking, failing,
        Nigh to earth,
    Mounting, whirling, sailing,
        Full of mirth;

    Life there, welling, flowing,
        Waving round;
    Pictures coming, going,
        Without sound.

    Quick now! be this airy
        Globe repell'd!
    Never can the fairy
        Star be held.

    Touch'd--it in a twinkle
        Disappears!
    Leaving but a sprinkle,
        As of tears.

NICK SPENCE.


    NICK SPENCE, Nick Spence,
    Sold the Cow for sixpence!
        When his Master scolded him,
            Nicky didn't care.
    Put him in the farmyard,
    The stableyard, the stackyard,
        Send him to the pigsty,
            And Johnny to the fair!

[Illustration]




AMBITION.


    THE Sea! as smooth as silk,
    And the froth of it like new milk,
    And the sky a wonderful blue,
    The cliff harebells have it too,
    And scatter'd all over the shore
    A thousand Children or more!

    Suppose we join, one-will'd,
    A City of Sand to build,
    With a rampart broad and strong
    From rock to rock along,
    Solid and firm enough
    To last till the sea grows rough
    And the days turn chilly and short,
    The end of our seaside sport,
    When all must bundle and pack
    And swift in the train go back,
    Big folk and little folk,
    To London lamps and smoke?

    Let's draw out our plan to-night,
    Begin it with morning light.
    We'll bring all the Children together
    And build in the sweet sunny weather.
    What use in a House of Sand?
    But a City--that _would_ be grand!
    O yes, I am sure it will stand!
    And I, who first thought of the thing,
    Perhaps they will make me King?

[Illustration]




THE BALL.


    ALL men, black, brown, red, yellow, white
    Are brethren in their Father's sight.
    To do each other good is right,
    But not to wrangle, steal, or fight.

    A thousand millions, young and old,
    Some in the heat, some in the cold,
    Upon this Ball of Earth are roll'd
    Around the Sun's great flame of gold.

[Illustration]

    And this great Sun is like indeed
    One daisy in a daisied mead;
    For GOD'S power doth all thought exceed.
    And of us also He takes heed.




RIDING.


        HIS Lordship's Steed
        Of a noble breed
    Is trotting it fleetly, fleetly,
        Her Ladyship's pony,
        Sleek and bonny,
    Cantering neatly, neatly.

        How shall they pass
        The Turf-Cadger's Ass,
    Creels and all, creels and all?
        Man on him bumping,
        Shouting and thumping,
    Heels and all, heels and all!

        Lane is not wide,
        A hedge on each side,
    The Ass is beginning to bray;
        "Now," says my Lord,
        With an angry word,
    "Fellow, get out of the way!"

        "Ha!" says the Cadger,
        As bold as a badger,
    "This way is _my_ way too!"
        Says the Lady mild,
        And sweetly smiled,
    "My Friend, that's perfectly true."

        The Cadger look'd round,
        Then jump'd to the ground,
    And into the hedge pull'd Neddy.
        "O thank you!" says she,
        "Ax pardon!" says he,
    And touch'd his old hat to the Lady.

        His Lordship's Steed
        Of a noble breed
    Went trotting it fleetly, fleetly,
        Her Ladyship's pony,
        Sleek and bonny
    Cantering neatly, neatly.

        The Cadger he rode
        As well as he could,
    Heels and all, heels and all,
        Jolting and bumping,
        Shouting and thumping,
    Creels and all, creels and all.

TOM CRICKET.


    TOM CRICKET he sat in his hole in the wall,
            Close to the kitchen fire,
    Up and down ran the Cockroaches all,
    Red coats and black coats, great and small;
    "Ho, Tom! our hearts are set on a ball,
            And your music we desire!"

    Tom sat in his hole, his horns hung out,
            He play'd away on his fiddle;
    The Cockroaches danced in a rabble rout,
    Scrambling and scurrying all about,
    Tho' they had their own steps and figures no doubt,
            Hands across, and down the middle.

    Till, "Stay!" says a Fat One,--"We're no Elves,
            To dance all night without stopping!
    Now for supper!" They help'd themselves,
    For the servants were gone to bed; on shelves
    And tables they quested by tens and twelves,
            And quick to the floor kept dropping.

    As a Cockroach ran by, says Tom Cricket to him,
            "Fetch me up a piece of potato,
    Good Sir!--to mix in the crowd I'm too slim."
    Says Jack Cockroach, "I see you are proud and prim;
    To eat alone is merely your whim,--
            Which I never will give way to!"

    "Come down," says he, "and look out for your share!"
            "I won't do that," says Tom Cricket.
    And when for another dance they care,
    And call upon Tom for a lively air,
    They find he has drawn himself back in his lair.
            "How shameful," they cry, "How wicked!"

    "Let's fill up the mouth of his cave with soot,
            Because he's behaved so badly!"
    They ran up and down the wall to do't;
    But ere half-done--a dreadful salute!
    In came the Cook, and the Scullion to boot,
            And off they all scampered madly.

THE YEAR OF HARDSHIPS.


                JANUARY,
                Bitter, very!
              February damp, Sir;
                March blows
                On April's nose,
        May has caught the cramp, Sir;
                    June,
            Without a sun or moon!
                July, August,
                Many a raw gust;
    September, October, November, December,
    Ten times worse than I ever remember.
      No apples, or hay, or honey, or corn;
        I'm sure it wasn't a fat year.
      Whenever you and I were born,
        Good-luck it wasn't in _that_ year!

[Illustration]




A RIDDLE.


    WHAT I say you'll scarce believe,
    Yet my words shall not deceive.
    I saw what seem'd a little Boy,
    With a face of life and joy;
    He danced, he ran, he nodded, he smiled,
    Just like any other Child;
    But could not speak, (how strange was this!)
    Or cry, or breathe, nor could I kiss,
    To save my life, the cherry red
    Of lips, not living and not dead!
    He was no picture, statue, doll;
    He was not a Child at all;
    He was Nothing, as near as could be,
    He was as real as you or me.
    --There he is: turn and see!
